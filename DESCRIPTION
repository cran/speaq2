Title: Wavelet Based Tools for Feature-Wise Analysis and Quantification
        of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectra
Author: Charlie Beirnaert, Kris Laukens
Maintainer: Charlie Beirnaert <charlie.beirnaert@uantwerpen.be>
Description: Tools for feature based analysis of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectra. Wavelets are
    used to quantify the peaks which are grouped into features with hierarchical
    clustering. The results can easily be incorporated in large-scale studies that include LC-MS analysis (as this is also peak/feature based).
